Notes:

- For a full breakdown of each working group's expenses, refer to Section 5. Each working group's status includes a link to the lead's report.
- The column titled `Spending (actual), JOY` represents the actual amounts spent by each working group, primarily on salaries. For the Marketing WG, this also covers various initiatives.
- Some payments in BWG covered also work done in prev. terms.
- MWG spending includes 6M JOY that was used for liquidity-raising initiatives, which included doubling the liquidity on Uniswap, creating a new pool with a lower commission fee and placing some orders on CEX until the end of next Term.
- Most salaries in the working groups are USD-denominated and subject to vesting schedules (determined at the beginning of each term) and an EMA30 limit, which was implemented this term. Consequently, the salaries do not reflect the current token price as they are affected by the EMA30 cap and vesting.
