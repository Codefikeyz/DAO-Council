### Review of Youtube partner program (with data from December 2024 – February 2025):

After reviewing the data, here’s a breakdown of the current state, issues noticed, and recommendations for optimizing the YPP rewards, especially focusing on incentivizing Silver+ creators who produce quality content and promote Joystream.

## **1. General Observations**

| Period | Total YPP Rewards (JOY) | Notable Observations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dec 12 | 42,297 | Balanced spread across tiers. |
| Dec 18 | 19,820 | Sharp decline in rewards and activity. |
| Jan 2 | 50,702 | High sync rewards, silver participation grew. |
| Jan 8 | 14,605 | Low activity, fewer payouts. |
| Jan 14 | 216,716 | Massive surge in signup + referral rewards (especially Bronze). |
| Jan 15-28 | 267,736 | High signup & referral rewards again, heavy concentration in Bronze. |
| Jan 28-Feb 4 | 68,750 | Reduced volume, more balanced. |
| Feb 4-11 | 52,857 | Minimal signup and referral rewards. |
| Feb 11-17 | 78,571 | Sharp Bronze referral spike (14k JOY to one channel). |
| Feb 18-24 | 81,640 | Moderate activity with high Silver sync rewards. |

## **2. Key Issues Noted:**

- **Overconcentration of Rewards in Bronze & Referral Programs:**
    - Signup rewards heavily favor Bronze tiers during spikes, reducing overall content quality.
- **Silver and Gold Not Properly Incentivized for Promotions:**
    - Sync rewards are steady for Silver and Gold, but no direct bonus exists to motivate them to promote Joystream externally.
    - Diamond channels are very few and not growing significantly.

## **3. Recommendations & Improvements:**

 **(implementing the suggestions below will need a product manager to further explore and continually improve the program, just like Dimitri did)**

### A. **Refine Bronze Signup and Referral Rewards:**

- Limit (stop) Bronze signup rewards to avoid flooding the platform with inactive or low-effort channels.
- Transition Bronze into more of a trial phase with minimal incentives. (see [bottom of page](https://www.notion.so/YPP-Review-1aadfd91c8f180f08051f8337dd421ca?pvs=21) for steps)

### B. **Introduce a Promotional Bonus Program for Silver, Gold & Diamond Tiers:**

**Program Concept: Promote & Earn Booster**

An incentive for Silver, Gold, and Diamond channels who:

1. Create content specifically promoting Joystream (explainer videos, tutorials, platform reviews, etc.).
2. Share their content externally (YouTube, X/Twitter, TikTok, Reddit) with proof of engagement.
3. Use verifiable links and hashtags to track performance.
4. Drive measurable traffic or new signups.
5. Meet minimum content quality and external engagement metrics.

### Reward Model Example:

| Tier | Sync Reward Adjustment | Promo Bonus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Silver | No sync reduction | Earn up to 50% extra via promotions. |
| Gold | No sync reduction | Earn up to 70% extra via promotions. |
| Diamond | No sync reduction | Eligible for 100% via promotions. |

This way:

- Base rewards are balanced.
- Only creators actively promoting get the extra bag.
- Higher tiers feel incentivized to compete for visibility.

### C. Appoint **a product manager:**

- Approve external promotion content.
- Establish a sustainable metric for participation and rewards.
- Audit referrals for spam or multi-account farming.
- Evaluate new signups, flag low-effort channels before payouts.
- Overall quality assurance and program improvement
- Smoothens payout curves and ensures sustainability.

## **4. Suggested Rewards Format Going Forward:**

| Category | Bronze | Silver | Gold | Diamond |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Signup | Cancelled | Unchnanged | Unchnanged | Unchnanged |
| Sync | Zero | Medium | High | Highest |
| Referral | Cancelled | Unchnanged | Unchnanged | Unchnanged |
| Promotion Bonus | None | Up to 50% of sync | Up to 70% of sync | Up to 100% of sync |
| Special Incentives | Trial phase only | Access to promos | Access to promos | Access to promos |

Note: Data for Referral rewards is unclear, it only states “up to $100” and not the exact amount paid for channel referral. This can be further reviewed and improved by the product manager.

### ** EXTRA
**Monthly “Top Promoter” Bonus**

- Identify top 5 Silver, Gold and Diamond creators based on:
    - Engagement.
    - Reach.
    - Traffic to Joystream.
- Allocate an extra monthly bonus from a fixed pool.

## **5. Benefits of This Approach:**

- Elevates content quality.
- Prevents abuse of Bronze-level farming.
- Encourages meaningful growth from Silver upwards.
- Aligns Joystream's visibility goals with creator incentives.

# BRONZE TRANSITION

Transitioning **Bronze** into a "trial phase" with minimal incentives helps filter for serious creators while still welcoming new ones. Here's a clear approach on how to implement this within the Youtube partner program:

### **How to Transition Bronze into a Trial Phase**

### 1. **Redefine Bronze Tier Purpose**

Position Bronze as: “A testing phase for new creators to explore Joystream, upload content, and demonstrate consistency and value before progressing to higher tiers.”

### 2. **Reduce Bronze Rewards**

- **Signup Reward:**
    - Set to zero.
- **Sync Rewards:**
    - Does not exist.
- **Referral Rewards:**
    - Disable.

### 3. **Set Clear Progression Criteria to Silver**

To unlock Silver, a Bronze creator must:

- Be active for at least 28 days. (activity to be determined by product manager)
- Upload at least 3-5 quality videos.
- Receive minimum engagement (views/comments/likes).
- Have no violations (copyright, spam, inactivity).

### 4. **Bronze Evaluations**

Every month (per council term), Interval can also be adjusted:

- Reviews most active Bronze creators.
- Promote those who meet criteria.

### 5. **Communicate the Trial Phase Clearly**

Update:

- Onboarding messages.
- YPP guidelines.
- Signup pages.
To clarify that Bronze is **temporary** and designed to test commitment before accessing real rewards.

### 6. **Add Incentives for Progression**

Offer a **one-time Silver Upgrade Bonus** (e.g., 1000 JOY) to motivate creators to complete the trial and move up.

### Why this works:

- Filters out unserious, spammy, or inactive channels.
- Reduces wasted funds on low-effort content.
- Encourages creators to work towards higher tiers.
- Keeps Joystream’s content quality high and sustainable.

NOTE: The recommendations and suggestions made above can further be improved for a more cost effective approach and maximum output.
